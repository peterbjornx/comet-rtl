DEC VAX-11/750 CPU RTL Model

This repository contains reverse engineered RTL for the gate arrays in
the DEC COMET (VAX-11/750) as well as verilog models of the circuit boards making up that minicomputer.

The tree is set up as following:

src\
src\dpm          - Data Path Module (circuit board)
src\dpm\logic_ic - Logic IC models for jellybean parts found on the board
src\dpm\alk      - Model for the ALK chip from reverse engineering

inc\             - Verilog headers
doc
doc\             - Documentation
ucode\           - Microcode definitions files transcribed/OCRed from CMT098 microfiche set.

Microcode transcription project will be kept in a separate repository
 to keep the source control history clean here
